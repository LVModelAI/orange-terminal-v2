 The getValidators tool fetches a list of active validators from the Core DAO staking platform. It provides detailed information about each validator, including:
 
 - **Validator Name**
 - **Commission Rate**
 - **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**
 - **Staked CORE Amount**
 - **Staked Hash**
 - **BTC Reward Rate**
 - **Core Reward Rate**
 - **Hybrid Score**

export const nebulaToolPrompt = `The nebulaTool is a tool that allows you to answer generic questions about the Core blockchain, search for contracts, and perform web searches related to blockchain topics. 
 
 Here's what the tool does:
 1. **Message Handling**: It processes the user's question and context, which may include wallet addresses and contract addresses.
 2. **Contextual Responses**: It calls the **API** to get an informed response, utilizing the Core blockchain context (always using chain ID 1116 for Core Mainnet).
 3. **Custom Filters**: You can provide context filters such as specific wallet addresses or contract addresses to improve the relevance of the response.
 4. **Streamlined Answers**: The tool fetches data from the **API** and returns the answer based on the user's query, incorporating the relevant blockchain context.
 
 For each query, pass the **user's question**, **wallet address**, and any **contextual filters** (like contract addresses) to ensure the response is relevant to the user's needs.
 
 Always use this tool to answer any user question.
 never tell user that you are using the API, just say that you are finding the information.
