export const coreDaoToolPrompt = `The coreDaoTool is a tool that allows you to answer questions about the Core blockchain, search for contracts, and perform web searches related to blockchain topics. 
 
Use this tool to do othe following: 
1. On-Chain Analysis & Data (Core Context)
  View your CORE token balance and all ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 holdings for any wallet on Core
  Analyze wallet and contract activity with transaction histories, by value or method
  Inspect smart contracts deployed on Core: see all functions, read contract roles, permissions, proxy status, etc.
  Review contract metadata, token info, and interface functions
2. Transaction Preparation & Execution (on Core)
  Prepare and queue transactions to:
  Transfer CORE or ERC20 tokens
  Mint or transfer NFTs (ERC721/1155)
  Call any smart contract function (approve, stake, claim, etc.)
  Deploy new ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 contracts natively on Core
  Set permissions/roles on tokens and contract systems
3. DeFi & Protocol Operations (on Core)
  Swap between supported tokens on Core (CORE, stablecoins, etc.)
  Prepare token approvals for dApps and protocols deployed on Core
  Aggregate and analyze DeFi protocol activity (volume, users, pools), as supported on Core
  View real-time token prices and supply for all Core-native assets
3. NFT Operations (Core Mainnet)
  Inspect NFT collections and metadata
  Query which wallets own NFTs on Core, for any collection
  Analyze NFT activity (mint, transfer, ownership) on Core
4. Developer/Data Utilities (for Core chain)
  Look up contract ABIs, function interfaces, and permission systems for any Core contract
  Convert CORE/other token values between wei and readable amounts (18 decimals for CORE)
  Convert Core block timestamps to readable dates and filter data by date
  Compute keccak hashes for permission roles (for Core contracts and tokens)
5. Other Analytics
  Aggregate all addresses transacting on Core â€” get unique users, daily, monthly, or by contract
  Check gas prices, latest block, block stats, and validator/miner activity.


 For each query, pass the **user's question**, **wallet address**, and any **contextual filters** (like contract addresses) to ensure the response is relevant to the user's needs.
 
 Always use this tool to answer any user question.
 never tell user that you are using the API, just say that you are finding the information.

export const getValidatorsPrompt = `
 The getValidators tool fetches a list of active validators from the Core DAO staking platform. It provides detailed information about each validator, including:
 
 - **Validator Name**
 - **Commission Rate**
 - **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**
 - **Staked CORE Amount**
 - **Staked Hash**
 - **BTC Reward Rate**
 - **Core Reward Rate**
 - **Hybrid Score**
 - **BTC Power and Hash Power**
 
 This tool helps users compare validators based on key metrics like yield, commission, and reward rates, allowing them to make informed staking decisions.

export const makeTransactionPrompt = `
  Use the makeTransaction tool to make a transaction ui for the user to sign on the Core blockchain.
  Pass the receiver, sender, amount, and chainId. The chainId is 1116 for the Core blockchain.

  First use the coreDaoTool to gather relevant information about the transaciton like token addresses, etc
  then after getting all relevant data, pass the data to this tool

  The transaction ui is a simple form with the following fields:
  - Receiver address
  - Sender address
  - Amount
  - ChainId
